# Biography

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in psychology at Stanford under the advisory of Professor
James L. McClelland. My research is on computational cognitive modeling,
i.e. identifying psychological constructs and understanding their mechanisms through
computer models such as neural networks. In particular, I am interested in logical
and mathematical reasoning which are essential cognitive faculties for inferencing,
problem solving, and decision making.
