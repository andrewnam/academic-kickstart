 abstract = "There is a polymorphism to Schools of Information that allows for a nimbleness of research that can travel outside of academically normative paths. The fuzzy borders between the school and its nearest departments are a product of the interdisciplinarity of its faculty composition and nature of the problems it takes on. The boundaries of the school are brought into relief as data science curriculum and research grow and the relationship of the school to computer science is necessarily considered. In this paper, we investigate the iSchool's relationship to Computer Science through the lens of course enrollment behavior of over 160,000 students at UC Berkeley between 2007 and 2015."
